# MSA 2025 Phase 2 - Travel Networking App

Welcome to my submission for the Microsoft Student Accelerator 2025 Phase 2! This project is a full-stack web application designed to connect travelers, share experiences, and plan trips together.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This application is a travel-centric social networking platform that allows users to create and share their travel plans, post updates from their journeys, and follow other travelers. It's built with a modern tech stack, featuring a React frontend and a .NET 8.0 backend, to deliver a seamless and engaging user experience.

### How it Relates to the Theme: **Networking**

The core of this application is built around the theme of **networking**. It's designed to connect people with shared interests in travel, fostering a community where users can:
-   **Follow** other travelers and stay updated on their journeys.
-   **Share** trip itineraries and experiences with friends and followers.
-   **Collaborate** on future trips by inviting friends to join their travel plans.

By providing a platform for travelers to connect and interact, the app encourages the formation of new friendships and travel groups, turning solo journeys into shared adventures.

## ‚ú® Advanced Features Implemented

As required, this project implements at least three advanced features to enhance its functionality and user experience:

-   [x] **Storybook for UI Component Development**: Storybook is integrated to develop, test, and document UI components in isolation, improving maintainability and collaboration across the team.
-   [x] **Theme Switching (Light/Dark Mode)**: Users can switch between light and dark themes to suit their preferences, with the selected theme persisted across sessions.
-   [x] **Dockerization**: The entire application is containerized using Docker, allowing for easy setup and deployment.
-   [x] **Redux for State Management**: The frontend uses Redux Toolkit for robust and predictable state management, ensuring data consistency across the application.
